# kaching
This script generates sets of random numbers according to two popular public lotteries in Singapore, 4D and Toto.
A revamp and improvement over the earlier [huat.sh](https://github.com/Aux-User/huat/tree/main), this one allows for two kinds of lottery styles and is able to generate multiple sets, as well as prompt the user if an invalid option was entered.

Good luck!
